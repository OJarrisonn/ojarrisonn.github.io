# Summary

In the beginning, networking was born and connected machines and people over distance. The Actor Model emerged, providing a framework for distributed computation. The 80s saw the rise of distributed systems, as resources were shared on networks. Erlang was born, a language designed for distributed systems that embraced the Actor Model, with each process behaving as an independent actor communicating with each other through messages.

This introduction was just to show how the Actor Model is closely related to distributed systems architecture. But what if it was not? What if someone built a centralized (non-distributed) application using a distributed system paradigm? What would be better? What would be worse? These are the questions that this project aims to respond to.

This work is about building a centralized application based on [patch-hub](https://github.com/kworkflow/patch-hub) in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) using the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime. The architecture used will be based on the Actor Model but adapted to Rust/Tokio and patch-hub needs.

To give some more context: patch-hub is a terminal application that helps Linux Kernel developers review contributions, so it has little to no need for concurrency/parallelism. It will be used as the laboratory to test different approaches to reimplement it using the Actor Model.

# Objectives

- Propose an architecture based on the Actor Model for centralized applications
- Build a centralized application using the Actor Model with modern technologies (Rust)
- Examine it from a user perspective
- Examine it from a software engineering perspective
